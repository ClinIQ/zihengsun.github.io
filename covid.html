    <h1>COVID-19 Community Social Risk Estimator (COSRE)</h1>

    <p>This tool is built based on the theory proposed in this 
    <a href="https://medium.com/@jensensunny/what-is-the-chance-of-meeting-a-covid-19-infected-person-in-grocery-stores-3ca7357fafb2">
        article</a>.</p>
        
    <p>The purpose of this tool is trying to give people a reasonable quantitative estimation about their risks of being exposed to the contact of COVID-19 virus in their communities, grocery stores, gyms, restaurants, work places, and public recreational areas. This is a pure statistical estimation calculated based on the data from public resources. The real chance could be very different from the results of this tool. Please use this tool with the knowledge preparation and interpret the results with caution. </p>
    
    <p><span style="color:red">WARNING:</span> The default number of people in the room is 100. This might be a underestimation of the situation. It should be adjusted according to the real situation. The virus might stay alive in the air or on the surface of matters for a while. In that interval, anybody contacted the air or the object surface might be infected. The number of people should count all the person who have passed the area within the virus active period. </p>
